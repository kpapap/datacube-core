Data Access & Analysis
**********************

For users looking to access data from the Open Data Cube the simplest way to get started is to access a sandbox environment for your Open Data Cube of interest.
Once you have access to a sandbox environment you'll be able to start searching, loading and analysing data.

The Sandbox prepares a JupyterLab environment for you. All necessary software is provided as part of this environment, so no additional installation or configuration is required.

- `Digital Earth Australia Sandbox`_
- `Digital Earth Africa Sandbox`_

Alternatively, you can also use the `Cube In a Box`_ to setup an Open Data Cube instance locally using Docker.
This instance can be configured to index a selection Sentinel-2 level 2 data.
